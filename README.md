Cause by Death

## Conclusion
Among the three countries taken for Analysis, we have concluded that Burkina Faso suffered from a huge number of losses due to Malaria and Measles. However, the situation had turned better in 2017 with the help of malaria consortium, US CDC and other help. Not only countries like Thailand and Japan but also other Asian countries like India, China do suffer from congenital diseases and reasons are poverty and illiterate population. More than 50 % of the under 5 age group deaths were due to preventable and treatable through simple and affordable methods. Better health policies and strengthening the health system will save many more lives in the future.
